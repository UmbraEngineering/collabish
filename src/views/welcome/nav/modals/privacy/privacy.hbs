	<h4>Information We Collect</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<strong>Information you give us.</strong>
			When you sign up for an account, we will ask you for some personal information, like email
			address and phone number.
		</li>

		<li>
			<strong>Information generated by using our services.</strong>
			Using collabish.me automatically generates information in a number of ways which we may collect
			for later use. This information includes the following:
			<ul>
				<li>
					Analytics Information
					<p>
						We use <a href="http://analytics.google.com">Google Analytics</a> to collect analytics
						data about our users and the ways in which they use our services. You can see their
						<a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/">privacy policy</a> on their
						website.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					Server Logs
					<p>
						Our servers constantly generate log files of their activities, some of which may contain
						your information. Specifically, we keep logs of each individual request to both our main
						web server and our API server, and these logs may contain information such as IP addresses,
						request bodies (which may contain personal information), search queries, and any data stored
						in the request headers, including cookies.
					</p>
				</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>



	<h4>How we use the information we collect</h4>
	<p>
		The information we collect is used to help us to provide you with better service and an overall better
		experience. For example, the analytics information helps us to gauge interest in specific features to
		know where we should focus our efforts. The server logs we collect help us to debug and fix problems
		that might arise in our application.
	</p>



	<h4>Information we share</h4>
	<p>
		We do <strong>not</strong> share personal information with third parties unless one of the following
		situations applies:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<strong>We have your consent.</strong>
			We will share information with others if you give us permission to do so.
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Hosting and storage.</strong>
			We have to store your data somewhere. We do not operate our own servers; We make use of the wonderful
			hosting services at <a href="http://heroku.com">Heroku</a>, and as such, all data that goes to and from
			our app goes through their servers. You can view their <a href="https://www.heroku.com/policy/privacy">
			privacy policy</a> on their website. We also make use of <a href="https://www.compose.io/">Compose</a>,
			a database hosting service, where our app data is stored in their MongoDB servers. You can also read
			their <a href="https://docs.compose.io/policies/privacy.html">privacy policy</a> at their website.
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>External processing.</strong>
			As we mentioned above, we make use of Google Analytics' services. This means that information about
			page views and our users ends up on their analytics servers.
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Legal reasons.</strong>
			We will share personal information if we believe it is reasonably necessary to meet an applicable law
			or enforceable government request, or to protect the rights and safety of Collabish and our users.
		</li>
	</ul>



	<h4>Security</h4>
	<p>
		We use SSL encryption for both our web server and API server, protecting your information while it is
		in transit between you and our servers. We also provide our users with several different authentication methods, including two-step verification for logins, to provide our users with extra protection against
		attempts to gain access to their account.
